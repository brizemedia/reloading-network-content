<h2>In the media</h2>

Hornady have [released a new product they are calling a "spray bar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR8mYuApG4I) 
which holds the cases in offset rows to apparently make it easier to uniforms apply your lubricant. This is a far 
cry from the "roll the cases around in a cardboard box while spraying them with 
[Dillon Case Lube](/docs/brass/case-lubricants#dillion-case-lube)" that I've been using for years.

Not new news, but with the advent of the [Garmin chronograph](http://localhost:3000/docs/chronographs/#garmin) being so 
well received it's great to see incumbent manufacturer [Caldwell](/docs/chronographs/#caldwell) throw its hat in the 
ring with a [new radar chronograph of its own called Velociradar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OXAO1MCNY0).

I've always found great success with Sierra components and they have dropped their new range of 
[MatchKing X (MKX)](https://sierrabullets.com/bullets/product-family/matchking-x/) in a variety of common calibers 
for extended range hunting. Here's a couple of bits on it. [Ultimate Reloader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc4P-O86FDg)

Some interesting brass related videos. [What happens when you anneal multiple times between firings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbGMVaqX-Tg),

<h2>On the boards</h2>

Stuck cases is par for the course. This is a great thread of people discussing 
[how they get them out](https://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1m02lok/the_best_feeling_ever_diy_stick_case_remover/).

A Redditor has created [an awesome looking loading tray](https://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1m0rxi7/3dprinted_reloading_tray_bullet_dish_for_65x55_se/) 
and shared the 3D print designs. This guy [built his own trickler](https://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1m1yr3w/opentrickler/)

Good to see [Woodleigh](https://www.woodleighbullets.com.au) getting [back in the swing of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/reloading/comments/1m1lpfp/glad_to_have_woodleigh_bullets_back_on_the_shelves/).
